# Semantic Spotter RAG for Insurance Documents

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a generative search system for insurance documents using LlamaIndex. The system is designed to process PDF documents, parse them into structured nodes, create vector embeddings, and enable accurate query responses. The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook and will be extended to provide a RESTful API using Flask.

## Components

### 1. PDF Reader

- **Purpose**: Extracts text and metadata from insurance policy PDF documents.
- **Functionality**: Reads the PDF files and converts the content into a format suitable for further processing.

### 2. Simple Node Parser

- **Purpose**: Parses the extracted text into logical units or nodes.
- **Functionality**: Converts the structured text into nodes that represent meaningful segments of information, making it easier to index and retrieve.

### 3. Vector Store Index

- **Purpose**: Creates a vector index for efficient search and retrieval.
- **Functionality**: Converts the nodes into vector embeddings and stores them in a vector index, enabling semantic search based on the content of the documents.

### 4. Query Engine

- **Purpose**: Processes user queries and retrieves relevant information.
- **Functionality**: Uses the vector index to find and return the most relevant nodes based on the user's query, providing accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

## API Development Plan

### Setup

- **Install Flask**: The Flask web framework will be used to develop the API that interacts with the generative search system.

### API Endpoints

- **/query**:
  - **Method**: POST
  - **Description**: Accepts a user query, processes it using the query engine, and returns the most relevant information from the insurance documents.
  - **Request Format**: JSON containing the query text.
  - **Response Format**: JSON with the response generated by the query engine.

### Integration

- **Initialization**: Components will be initialized, and the document will be processed to create nodes and index them.
- **Query Handling**: The API will handle incoming queries, process them, and return the results based on the indexed information.

## Project Structure

- **/pdf_reader.py**: Contains the implementation for reading and extracting text from PDF documents.
- **/node_parser.py**: Implements the parsing of text into structured nodes.
- **/vector_store.py**: Manages the creation and maintenance of the vector index.
- **/query_engine.py**: Handles query processing and retrieval of relevant nodes.
- **/app.py**: The Flask application that exposes the API endpoints.

## Dependencies

- Flask
- LlamaIndex
